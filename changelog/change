users --> nginx 5012 --	|
			+--- host/stream ---> (mjpeg-streamer) localhost:5022

using the Tornado for make flask more reliable server.

Error using the RPI0, the adafruit library does not contain the Raspberry_Pi_Driver but only the Raspberry_Pi2_Driver
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Adafruit_DHT-1.2.0-py2.7-linux-armv7l.egg/Adafruit_DHT/Raspberry_Pi.py", line 22, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name Raspberry_Pi_Driver

------- Future releases: -----------

NOTE:
So that meant using RPIO for PWM (DMA) and GPIO for GPIO.  Luckily a little bit of hackery made that easy:

import RPIO.PWM as PWM
import RPi.GPIO as RPIO


NOTE:

Command to dump log: sudo python bentornado.py >> logfile.log 2>&1
