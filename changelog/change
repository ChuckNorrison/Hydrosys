the network interfaces are not editable in the file /etc/network/interfaces

now it is required to use wpa_supplicant file starting from Weezy jessie.

The wifi network modules should go and write on wpa_supplicant file

introduced wpa_cli_mod

Change 50->51

introducing the APscheduler 3.0

2016-09-20 -> release 51.01

fix the power pin enable/disable to support multithread

fix the "hydropicture" folder issue in case folder is not present (Hardwaremod.py)

introduced the bash file to autoinstall dependencies and program on jessie lite OS. (install_hydrosys4.sh)


2016-11-5 -> release 52

Introduce video page in the menu
video provided by using the mjpeg-sreamer

Fixed BUG on the mail wihtout any picture in the image folder

2016-11-12 

update install.sh including the installation of mjpeg-streamer (not tested)

update video page

tested the video quality with different setups (only trouble is direct connection with smartphone, direct connection with PC is ok

included the raspicam input for resolutions higher than 1024 only on video0

Check the result with Edimax EW-7811UN wifi dongle on raspberry Zero

2016-11-26 -> release 53

using NGINX as reverse proxy server to route video and hydrosys server on single port

                  	+--- host --------> (Tornado) localhost:5020
users --> nginx 5012 --	|
			+--- host/stream ---> (mjpeg-streamer) localhost:5022

using the Tornado for make flask more reliable server.

Error using the RPI0, the adafruit library does not contain the Raspberry_Pi_Driver but only the Raspberry_Pi2_Driver
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Adafruit_DHT-1.2.0-py2.7-linux-armv7l.egg/Adafruit_DHT/Raspberry_Pi.py", line 22, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name Raspberry_Pi_Driver

This can be easily fixed later.


-----
the connection stuck in undefined state when try to move to wifi was fixed simply by removing the wifi network from GUI and recreate it.
