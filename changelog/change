2022-02-09 -> release 337c

- Continue building the integration

2022-02-09 -> release 337e

- Add the pulse "ON" / "OFF" function. In this case the pulse will act as a switch. In this function the powerpin will not work.
- reason to exclude the powerpin in Pulse ON is safety, expecially for the wireless actuators providing the ON command without any timer could lead to the situation that the OFF command is not recived, keeping the actuator runnin indefinitly. As this system will mainly manage the irrigation, pump or vaòve open indefinitly is a issue.
So no power pin enabled for the pulse ON option.

2022-02-12 -> release 338

- Integrated the I2C expansion board and the HC12 actuators (still MQTT tasmota part to be done)

2022-02-16 -> release 338e

- HASSIO integration, fixed all the visible issues.
- According to the Home Assistant documentation the MQTT discovery configuration is not Permanent, which is unexplicable.
This means that after the MQTT discovery configuration has been push to home assistant, in case the system restart, the comfiguration is lost and should be push again. Completely unexplicable why this cannot be considered as a normal configuration. Hopefully in the future this will be changed.
