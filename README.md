# Hydrosystem

This software has been created for people who loves nature :). It is a SW platform to be loaded on the raspbery pi 3 which let you easily controls and record sensors ad use some actuator as water pumps, valves to control the watering of your loved plants.
Anyway there is more, apart for nature lovers, this SW can be used as a platform for several applications. 
The SW platform is based on a web interface where the webserver is running locally on the raspberry. The SW is designed to be used with smartphone and to be reachable from internet without need of external servers. The basic concept is to avoid extra fees, Static IP fees, Dynamic DNS fess. Also the supporting hardware platform and sensors are choosen to be inexpensive.
