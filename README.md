# Hydrosystem

This project aim to create a platform for the raspbery pi 3 which let you easily controls and record sensors data, use actuators through the GPIO and play with analog by usgin external ADC. The platform is based on web server interface and the program has control over the WiFi interface. The webserver interface can be adjusted to support many purposes, the first application that I developed was the Waterin irrigation system, email integration system and later the video from cameras.
The SW platform is based on a web interface where the webserver is running locally on the raspberry. The SW is designed to be used with smartphone and to be reachable from internet without need of external servers. 
The basic concept is to develop a platoform for the internet of things which is not centralized, then to avoid extra fees, Static IP fees, Dynamic DNS fees and control. 
The mainstream IoT products relies on central server architecture which binds user to annual fees, the server is also a single point of failure in case of security problems. 
For the designed applications the supporting hardware platform and sensors are choosen to be inexpensive.
